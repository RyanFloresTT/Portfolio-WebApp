        Hey there!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a HUGE gamer! Ever since I was a kid, I've been hooked on the immersive worlds and challenging gameplay of video games. World of Warcraft grabbed me early – started playing it at eight, sharing an account with my mom. Walking through Ashenvale as a Night Elf priest felt like pure magic.

        Warcraft 3, thanks to my uncle, blew my mind with its level editor. That's when I thought, "I wanna be a game developer!" Minecraft days with my cousin were a blast – building automated machines and diving into Java for my first modding attempts.

    <p>
        That led my 12 year old self to copy a YouTube tutorial, in which I 'made' my first game, and then jumped into Unity and C#. Playing games with family deepened our connections. Whether teaming up with my dad in WoW or crafting structures with my cousin in Minecraft, those moments fueled my passion for game development.
